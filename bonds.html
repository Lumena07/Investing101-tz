         <h1> Bonds</h1>
        <p>Bonds are a form of debt issued by a company or government that wants to raise some cash. In essence, when an entity issues a bond, it asks the buyer or investor for a loan. So when you buy a bond, you're lending the bond issuer money.<br> In exchange, the issuer promises to pay back the principal amount to you by a certain date and sweetens the pot by paying you interest at regular intervals—usually semi-annually</p>

        <p>In Tanzania bonds are mostly issued by the government in terms of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds,though corporate bonds are also available
 </p>

                    <h2> TREASURY BILLS</h2>
                    <p>Treasury bills are short-term government securities, which are issued at discount and mature in less than a year.  Currently, the Bank of Tanzania issues on behalf of the Government of Tanzania, treasury bills in four maturities, namely 35, 91, 182 and 364 days. The minimum bid amount for Treasury bills is TZS 500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand Tanzania Shillings in multiples of TZS 10,000.</p>
                    <h2> TREASURY BONDS</h2>
                    <p>Treasury bonds are long-term debt instruments with a maturity period of more than one year and pay interest on semiannual basis. Treasury bonds issued by the Bank of Tanzania are in six maturities: 2, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 years. They are issued at fixed interest rate (coupon). The minimum bid amount for Treasury bonds is TZS 1,000,000 in multiples of TZS 100,000 </p>
