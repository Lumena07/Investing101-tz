    <p>As young adults beginning the journey to financial freedom we learn different ways of achieving that, one among them being investing.Many times when we read about investing  either online or  by reading books ,the basic examples given do not relate to the Tanzanian environment.Therefore this website introduces some investment opportunities available at home and how to take advantage of them and reach your financial goals.</p></div>

    <h1>What Is Investing and Why You Should Care</h1>
    
    <p>Investing can mean different things to different people. While investing for some people means putting in money to achieve profit, for some other it can also mean investing time or effort for some future benefit such as investing in oneself’s skills or health</p>
    <br>
<p>In this context, we will define <strong> Investing </strong>as “putting money into financial product, shares, property, or a commercial venture with the expectation of achieving a profit”.</p>
<br>

<p id="important"> <em>Investing, at its heart, is the trading of your money today for a lot more money in the future.</em> </p>

  <h2>Savings vs Investing </h2>

 <p>Investing is also sometimes mixed up with saving (interest rate only).An investment is generally different from savings as an investment is a more active way of using your extra money while saving is generally understood as storing a part of your income example in a bank</p>
